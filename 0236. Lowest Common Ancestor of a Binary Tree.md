## Problem
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

```
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
```

## Approach
Recursively check for nodes on both the branches:
- if both branches return non-null value, then current root is the common ancestor
- if root is same p or q, then current node can be potential common ancestor

## Code
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null)
            return null;

        if(root == p || root == q)
            return root;
        
        TreeNode foundInLeft = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode foundInRight = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

        if(foundInLeft != null && foundInRight != null)
            return root;

        if(foundInLeft != null) {
            return foundInLeft;
        }
        if(foundInRight != null)
            return foundInRight;

        return null;
    }
}
```
